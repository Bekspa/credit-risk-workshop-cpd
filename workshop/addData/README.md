# Importing data in your projects

There are many ways to bring your data into your project, in this section we'll cover using from the following data sources:

* Using virtualized data

>*Note: The lab instructions below assume you have your project already available. If not, follow the instructions in the pre-work section to create a project.*

## Using Virtualized Data

For this section we'll explore the data that is available from the virtualized views that have been created in Data Virtualization. This data may come from various data sources or tables within a single source, but will appear as a single data asset. We will add this data to a project so that it can be used.

### Assign the data to your project

* From the upper-left (â˜°) hamburger menu, click on *Collect* -> *Data Virtualization*, you'll be brought to the *My data* section. Here you should see the data you can access (or that the administrator has assigned to you).

> _Note: Depending on your user role. When going to *Data Virtualization*, you may be brought to the *'Virtualize'* page instead of the *'My data'* / *'My virtualized data'* page. If that happens, click on the `Menu` option under *'Data virtualization'* and select the *'My virtualized data'* option._

* Select the checkbox next to the data sets you want to use in your project and click the *`Assign`* button to start importing it to your project.

> _Note: The name of the data assets to select may vary based on names chosen during data virtualization. The default names to select are: LOANS, APPLICANTFINANCIALDATA, APPLICANTPERSONALDATA, APPLICANTFINANCIALPERSONALDATA AND APPLICANTFINANCIALPERSONALLOAN_

* In the 'Assign virtual objects' screen, choose the project where you want to assign the data. If there is a `Submit to catalog` checkbox on the top right, unselect it and finally click the *Assign* button to add the data to your project.

* In the pop up panel, you will receive a confirmation that the objects have been assigned to your project. Click the *`Go to project`* button.

* In the project page, clicking on the `Assets` tab will show the virtualized tables and joined tables that are now in your project.

 **Do not go to the next section until you see the data assets in your project.**

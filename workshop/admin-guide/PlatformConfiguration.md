* There are two approaches that can be followed for adding user accounts that participants will use:

   1. If you are pre-creating user accounts for participants. Click on the `New user` option. Fill in the account details using a pattern (i.e user100, user101, user102, etc). Ensure you select the Roles necessary for the modules that will be executed at the workshop (at minimum: `Developer`, `Data Scientist`, `Data Steward`, and `Data Engineer`)
   1. If you the attendees are creating / requesting an account on their own from the CP4D login page. When you arrive at the `Manage Users` page, the requested accounts will be displayed. For each new account, click the edit icon (i.e pencil): assign the necessary roles and change the `Account Status` to approved. Click the `Save` button.

## Add DV Users and Roles

We need to add the CP4D user accounts to Data Virtualization, so attendees will have access and also assign the "Steward" role to the account.

* Go to *Data Virtualization* option from the menu. 

* Click on *User management*
